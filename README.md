# MachineLearningCardiacArrestPreciction
early detection of cardiac arrests using machine learning techniques. Cardiac arrest is a critical medical condition that often occurs suddenly and can be life-threatening. Early detection can significantly improve a patient's chances of survival.

Various used Algorithms in this project:

Random Forest 
SVM
KNN
Logistic Regression
and others.

Usage:

Once the project reaches a certain level of maturity, you'll be able to use the model for cardiac arrest prediction by inputting relevant patient data.

Future Enhancements:

We have plans to expand the project by incorporating additional features such as real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and integration with healthcare systems.
